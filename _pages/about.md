I am a Student at the University of Trento currently undertaking my master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Data Science.
I received my B.Sc. at University of Trento in 2022, where I was advised by [Alberto Montresor](https://cricca.disi.unitn.it/montresor/) for my thesis project on Stellar as an alternative to the Bitcoin Proof-of-Work consensus protocols.

During my time at the University of Trento, I actively contributed to many open source projects including the [NASA FPrime](https://github.com/nasa/fprime) framework - a flight software and embedded systems framework - and the [Data & Analytics Framework](https://docs.italia.it/italia/daf/) for the Italian Developers community - a community of developers who code and design Italian digital public services. 

I participated in the [Google Summer of Code 2022](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/t87xbcg2) as a software developer for the [R project for statistical computing](https://www.r-project.org/) to integrate the [RcppDeepState](https://github.com/FabrizioSandri/RcppDeepState) library with GitHub Actions - [RcppDeepState-action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/rcppdeepstate).
