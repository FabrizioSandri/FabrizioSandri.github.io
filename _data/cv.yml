      year: 2022

      description: I actively contributed to the RcppDeepState project throughout the Google Summer of code 2022 as a Software Engineer. 
            <p class="ml-1 ml-md-4">RcppDeepState is an R library to fuzz test compiled code in Rcpp packages. The package extends the DeepState framework to fully support Rcpp based packages. RcppDeepState allows you to fuzz test your R library's C++ code in order to find more subtle bugs like memory leaks or even more general memory errors.</p>
